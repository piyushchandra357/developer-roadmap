# Data Structures And Algorithms

Data structures and algorithms are the base of computer science. They play a  major role in implementing software and in the hiring process as well. Tech giants like google and amazon specifically look for programmers who have a good problem-solving and coding skill (Focus area data Structures and Algorithms). 

# How to begin 

 ### Learn a Programming Language ###
 It is highly recommended that you choose one of C/C++ or Java.The reason being  C/C++ and Java are relatively faster, particularly when compared to languages like Python. Pick any 1 language and spend a good time understanding the basic concepts such as loops,arrays etc.You can use [GeeksForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) for tutorials.
 
 ### Learn about basic data structures and algorithms
 
 At beginners stage, you should first cover :
* Time coplexity and Big O Notation ([youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V42FBiohc6c&list=PL2_aWCzGMAwI9HK8YPVBjElbLbI3ufctn))
* Basic searching algorithms like [linear](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linear-search/) and [binary search](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-search/)
* Sorting techniques : [Bubble sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bubble-sort/), [Selection Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/selection-sort/) and [insertion sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/insertion-sort/)
* Recursion ( An Introduction to Recursion [Part 1](https://www.topcoder.com/community/competitive-programming/tutorials/an-introduction-to-recursion-part-1/),[Part 2](https://www.topcoder.com/community/competitive-programming/tutorials/an-introduction-to-recursion-part-2/), [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OmRGjbyzno&list=PL2_aWCzGMAwLz3g66WrxFGSXvSsvyfzCO))
* Basic data structure like [stack](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stack-data-structure-introduction-program/), [queue](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-set-1introduction-and-array-implementation/) and [linked list](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linked-list-set-1-introduction/).

 
 The next step is to start practising on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/).It has a great IDE and a wonderful beginners program which will help you in getting started. Hackerrank has a great set of problems whose difficulty increases gradually and hence you will not face a sudden rise or fall of difficulty

### Starting with actual online competitions

Once you are familiar with time complexities, I/O operations of online IDE’s and the above algorithms you can start with actual competitions for which the following 2 sites provide the best environment for competing with others:

* [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard) 30 days of code: Good for practice purpose especially for a beginner.

* [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com): offers 3 monthly contests:
->Long Challenge: This is a 10-day long contest and is one of the best contest to start Competitive Programming with as it does not have any wrong answer penalty and gives you a lot of time to think and implement your solution for a particular problem. If you are a beginner, you first goal should be to do well in this challenge. If you are able to solve first 4-5 of the challenge, you are good to go. At the end of the challenge, make very sure to go through the editorial provided by them. This is extremely important.
->Cook-Off: This is a much shorter contest that lasts for 2.5 hours and features 5 problems of varying difficulty, this contest will teach you how to think and implement a solution within a given time constraint
->Lunch Time: This is a 3-hour contest meant for school students. A Lunchtime usually features 4 problems.

* [CodeForces](http://codeforces.com/): 4 to 5 short contests of 2 hour in a month . This too like codechef have great editorials to its problems.


### Digging a bit Deeper

After covering above mentioned algorithms, you should learn the rest of DSA in following order:
* Euclid’s GCD Algorithm([youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HCd074v8g8))
* [Greedy Algorithm](https://www.topcoder.com/community/competitive-programming/tutorials/greedy-is-good/)
* [Dynamic Programming](https://www.topcoder.com/community/competitive-programming/tutorials/dynamic-programming-from-novice-to-advanced/)
* [Merge Sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LOwPhPDwVc) , [Quick sort](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COk73cpQbFQ) and [Counting Sort](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/counting-sort/).

### Advanced
* Heaps (priority queue)
* Segment Trees
* Binary Index Tree (Fenwick tree)
* Trees (traversals, tree dynamic programming)
* Finding Lowest Common Ancestors (O(log N) solution where N is number of nodes).
* Graph Algorithmslike
 Finding connected components and transitive closures,
 Shortest-path algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall),
 Minimum spanning tree (Prim and Kruskal algorithms).
* Topological Sorting, 
 Euler path, tour/cycle
 Divide and Conquer
 Sieve of Eratosthenes

 There are a plethora of resouces available on the internet. We recommend you the following ones:
 * MIT 6.011, Introduction to Algorithms([youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtSuA80QTyo&list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb))
 * Cousera's Stanford University's Algorithm Sepcializaton [link](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms). The whole program is divided into 4 courses. You can apply for a full financial aid by filling out their application.
 * Other youtube channels - [My Code School](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92S4zgXN17o&list=PL2_aWCzGMAwI3W_JlcBbtYTwiQSsOTa6P) .

# Some Special Contests

*  [Google Codejam](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam): The competition happens annually. The top 25 contestants for the World Finals Round are brought onsite, and the winner gets a prize money of 15,000$. The top finishers are usually reached out for a potential job opportunity.
*  [FaceBook Hackercup](https://www.facebook.com/hackercup/): The winner gets a prize money of 10,000$. Just as with CodeJam, the top finishers are reached out for a potential job opportunity. 
*  [ACM ICPC](https://icpc.baylor.edu/): It is like the olympics of CP. Universities world over host online and regional onsite competitions, and the winners from these advance to the World Finals.

Keep Learning.
